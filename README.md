# Augment-Path-Matching

The code is written in R and uses the Edmonds' algorithm for maximum cardinality matching in a bipartite graph. The code reads a preference matrix from a CSV file, constructs a bipartite graph, and then finds the maximum matching using the augmenting-path algorithm. The results are then written to a CSV file (Appendix 1 - Programming Codes, Page 11).
