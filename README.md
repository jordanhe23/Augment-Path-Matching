# Augment-Path-Matching

The code is written in R and is intedned to tackle an optimization problem related to assigning students to their preferred classes. The code uses the Edmonds' algorithm for maximum cardinality matching in a bipartite graph. The code reads a preference matrix from a CSV file, constructs a bipartite graph, and then finds the maximum matching using the augmenting-path algorithm. The results are then written to a CSV file.
